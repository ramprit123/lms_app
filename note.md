- `config/`: Configuration files.
- `providers/`: Context providers for data fetching and state management.
- `store/`: Redux store for global state management.
- `assets/`: Contains images, fonts, and other static assets.

## Key Components

- `_layout.tsx`: Defines the layout for the app, including navigation.
- `index.tsx`: The main entry point for the app.
- `ScreenContent.tsx`: A reusable component for displaying screen content.
- `Button.tsx`: A custom button component.
- `Container.tsx`: A container component for consistent styling.

## Data Fetching

The app uses `strapi-provider.ts` to fetch data from a Strapi CMS.
